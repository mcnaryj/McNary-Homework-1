# HORISEON

HORISEON is a website about search engine optimization.

## Installation/Viewing the Files

Download the files contained in the McNary-Homework-1 repository, either through Github or by making a clone of the repository and downloading it locally. Once downloaded, open the file index.html to view the webpage.

#Purpose
The purpose of this README is to explain how the website has been made to be more user-accessible than it was previously. Along with meeting accessibility standards, the website meets the following acceptance criteria:
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title```

The content has been altered to read semantically, and the order of both the index.html as well as the style.css file has been modified to follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
The image and icon attributes have been amended to include alt text, and are arranged in sequential order.
The title is the name of the company. I have elected to use this title as companies like Google will have that be the title (or new tab), and the one word should be enough to inform the user about the page.

## Contributing
I will be providing the url for the sit via the github repository, however any pull requests are welcome.
